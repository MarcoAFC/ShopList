## About the project

This project aims to implement a Flutter application to assist in building a simple shopping list
with automatic calculation regarding partial cost per item and total cost of the purchase,
allowing quick and effective viability analysis when at the market.

It is the **first part of the CookBook project** and is released as a public repository for propagation
of the general idea and to allow anyone interested to take a look at how it works.

## Goal

Learning and applying useful Flutter concepts while developing a ready-to-use tool for daily life.
